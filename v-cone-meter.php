                        <p>The V-Cone flow meter is an advanced technology that takes differential pressure flow measurement to a new level. The V-Cone flow meter has proven its performance in the oil and gas industry in some of the harshest operating conditions and for the widest variety of fluid types. In these applications, the V-Cone flow meter consistently outperforms traditional dP devices and other major flow technologies.</p>

                        <h3 class="lead fw-semibold mt-5">Ideal for Wet Gas and Steam</h3>
                        <p>The V-Cone flow meter's ability to measure wet gas, steam, or condensate is unique in the industry. In side-by-side tests with other dP technologies, only the V-Cone flow meter provided accurate measurement of these challenging flow regimes.</p>

                        <h3 class="lead fw-semibold mt-4">Superior Performance</h3>
                        <p>The V-Cone flow meter delivers an accuracy to ±0.5% of rate and ±0.1% repeatability (depending on fluid type) under a variety of conditions. It also handles turndowns of 10:1 and greater, without loss of accuracy. The V-Cone flow meter has an unprecedented long life of twenty-five years or more.</p>

                        <h3 class="lead fw-semibold mt-4">Low Installed Cost</h3>
                        <p>When retrofitting existing applications, the V-Cone flow meter fits right in place without having to re-engineer the piping layout because it does not require long straight pipe runs. The V-Cone's built-in flow conditioner allows for this installation flexibility, which saves cost, space, and minimizes weight penalty problems.</p>

                        <h3 class="lead fw-semibold mt-4">Wide Range of Flows and Fluids</h3>
                        <p>The V-Cone flow meter handles most every flow condition because it acts as its own flow conditioner. This not only allows maximum installation flexibility, but accurate measurement of disturbed or swirling flows. In addition, the V-Cone flow meter is designed to withstand abrasive, dirty and particle-laden flows without significant wear.</p>

                        <h3 class="lead fw-semibold mt-4">Low Total Cost of Ownership</h3>
                        <p>With no moving parts to replace or maintain, the V-Cone flow meter assures long-term performance without the operating costs of other flow meters. The contoured aerodynamic shape of the cone profiles the flow in the pipe without impacting it against a sharp beta edge.</p>

                        <h3 class="lead fw-semibold mt-4">Design Flexibility</h3>
                        <p>The V-Cone flow meter is available in line sizes from 0.5" to greater than 120" in an extensive variety of construction materials with beta ratios to suit any application. The V-Cone flow meter can be jacketed, painted, coated, or treated like any other piece of piping. The V-Cone flow meter is regularly calibrated, tested and certified to the most demanding specifications.</p>
