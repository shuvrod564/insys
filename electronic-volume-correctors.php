                        <p>MX-3000S is an ultra-flat and compact volume conversion device complete with integrated modem which is based on modern components ensuring precise volume calculation and measurement of  pressure and temperature with high accuracy.</p>
                        <p>The MX-3000S gas volume conversion device belongs to the latest generation of modern gas volume converters designed for installation in hazardous areas. It is based on proven technology and takes full advantage of the architecture of modern processors with low energy consumption and high computing performance. MX-3000S has been designed to be easily mounted in small spaces and close to any type of pulse output meter, giving customers the ability to easily implement a high performance smart solution at a very competitive price. The original design allows the converter to be fixed on commercial and industrial membrane gas meters. The batteries can be replaced without breaking the metric seal. All information is available on an alphanumeric LCD combined with icons that clearly show all the measured data and the operating speeds of the device. The six keys on the keypad allow intuitive use of the device. MX-3000S is powered by two separate lithium batteries of which one battery is dedicated for volume conversion and the second ensures power to the modem.</p>
                        <p>The integrated modem allows remote transfer of stored data. High accuracy and stability of temperature and pressure transducers guarantee without problems functioning for a long time.</p>
                        <p>MX-3000S is designed to convert the volume of gas under operating conditions into volume of gas under standard conditions according to the equation of state. For this purpose, the converter reads the pulses from the meter and measures the temperature and pressure of the gas.</p>
