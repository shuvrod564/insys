                        <p>Diaphragm gas meters are positive displacement natural gas flow meters that are primarily used in residential and small commercial installations. They are a reliable and low-cost means of measuring a minimal gas flow for billing purposes</p>

                        <p>
                            A G1.6 diaphragm gas meter is a volumetric diaphragm gas meter that measures the volume of natural gas, city pipe gas, liquid gas, marsh gas, and other gases. It can measure gas consumption in the range of 0.016 to 2.5 m³/h. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Diaphragm gas meter is available in sizes G1.6 and G2.5. The meter is characterized by precise measurements, a constant measuring stability, a long life and high reliability. Thanks to the use of high-grade materials, the diaphragm gas meter is resistant to corrosion.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The gas meter is suitable for various gas media. The integrated calibration system coordinates the movement of the valves in relation to the optimum gas flow. The excellent linearity of the error curve is guaranteed even at low flow rates. Due to the optimum rotating characteristics of the valves the Qmin value remains stable and the gas meter is resistant to contamination.

                        <p>
                            Diaphragm gas meters are available from G2.5 to G10 range for commercial applications. They are volumetric diaphragm gas meters that measure the volume of natural gas, city pipe gas, liquid gas, marsh gas, and other gases. It can measure gas consumption in the range of 0.016 to 10 m³/h. All meters work under pressure requirements of 1 bar only.
